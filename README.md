# KSES

KSES Stops Evil Scripts!

Prevent XSS attacks by removing unwanted HTML elements and attributes from HTML strings.


## History of KSES

So far as I can tell, the original KSES developer was [Ulf Harnhammar](https://web.archive.org/web/20120701131755/http://advogato.org:80/person/metaur). This repo's first code commit is taken directly from Harnhammar's [SourceForge repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kses/) to facilitate a paper trail to the original dev.
